# Pac-Man
This is Pac-Man clone made for training. It's done without canvas and can be visited here: https://dominikgorczyca.github.io/Pac-Man/

Done in 2 months, it was an experience that teached me a lot and was probably a hardest project I ever made. 

Started by making a map, it was done by carefully using before and after elements, later, I made a sprite file out of map elements because I saw problems with objects rendering on small scale. 

Then I started logic, first Pac-Man logic, winning animation, losing animation, ghosts, because it was made in vanilla, I really had to up the performance so there's no delay that would make the game look awkward. After over a month of work, it was less or more done, while I don't plan on making games in the future, it still showed me a lot, like how to operate sounds, how to find bugs in a bigger project, how to use Google Chrome Dev Tools, how to make efficient animations and many more.
